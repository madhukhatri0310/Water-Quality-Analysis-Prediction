# Water-Quality-Analysis-Prediction
This project is centered around the analysis and prediction of water potability using a dataset containing various chemical properties of water. The goal is to use machine learning to check if water samples are potable based on features such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity.
